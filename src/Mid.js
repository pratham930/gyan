<h1>SAFETY OF APPLE OF YOUR EYES</h1>

<p>As our concern is the safety of the apple of your eye,
     so we have chosen every safety parameter wisely across the hostel and residential area of our CBSE Academy.
      Some of the safety measures are Security guards, night watchmen across the residential, especially near hostels. Besides this, we have closed circuit cameras to watch the activities in the classroom, hostel, games field and others. With all these qualities in our bucket, Gyan Ganga International Academy becomes the best choice for the apple of your eyes.</p>
